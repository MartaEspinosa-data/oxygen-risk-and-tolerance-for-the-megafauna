# oxygen-risk-and-tolerance-for-the-megafauna
Data engineering project to measure species oxygen exposures to assess risks of low oxygen based on the hypothesis that species risk varies spatially and is dependent on the interaction of shelf oxygen dynamics with habitat pattern, species mobility, and tolerance to low oxygen.
